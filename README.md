# ccp-simulated-annealing
Final assignment for UFRGS' combinatorial optimization course (2018/1). Simulated annealing was used to solve instances of the Capacitated Clustering Problem (CCP).

## Usage

The parameters received by simulatedAnnealing.py are described when calling it with the "**-h**" argument.

The first two parameters are obligatory and positional. The first one is a path to the file in which the algorithm's execution log will be saved; the second one is a path to a file that contains an instance of the capacitated clustering problem.

**Example of a valid path for the log file:**
```
"D:/UFRGS/Quinto Semestre/Otimização Combinatória/Trabalho final/Outputs/log.txt"
```
